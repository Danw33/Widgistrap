# Widgistrap
Widgistrap is a simple, responsive, and widgitised WordPress theme built around Twitter's Bootstrap. 
It's designed with simple in mind, with the ability to re-style the theme through the use of child-themes to suite an individual site's needs.

## About Widgistrap
The theme is currently pre-alpha, barely works, and is in it's initial development stages.
In its current state **It could break your site**, destroy your home, burn down your village, and cause global devastation *- I wouldn't use it yet if I were you, but I'm not you so be my guest!*

## Authors and Awesome Third-Parties
Widgistrap is developed by Daniel Wilson, but wouldn't be possible without many other developers and their devotion to open-source software!
 - Twitter's Bootstrap
 - twittem's wp-bootstrap-navwalker
 - TidyThemes' BlankSlate
 - Automattic's WordPress
